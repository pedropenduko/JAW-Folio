# JAW-Folio

Just Another WordPress Portfolio Theme - is a fully responsive WordPress Portfolio theme based on the UnderScores theme. 

## Note

This theme is currently dependent on the following free plugins:

1. Advanced Custom Fields by Elliot Condon - this is used to create the variables needed to hold the texts and images in the different sections of the theme.

2. Custom Post Type UI by WebDevStudios - this is used to add custom post types such as: Services, Featured Projects, Skills and Testimonies

3. Contact Form 7 by Takayuki Miyoshi - for the beautiful and easy to use contact form.

In my spare time, I will develop a plugin to automatically add the custom post types and custom fields needed by the theme. 

I'll be adding here the details on what custom fields and the custom post types are to be added to get the theme working soon. 

For now, if you wish to use this JAW-Folio theme, you may contact me through my site: https://rommellaranjo.m-e.site.
